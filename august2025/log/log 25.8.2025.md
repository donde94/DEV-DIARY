Study notes on **bits, transistors and CPU** history and manufacturing  

- Started learning basics of binary numbers (0/1 states, 2^n combinations)  
- Notes on transistors (MOSFET, gates, carry in/out, overflow)  
- Compared 32-bit vs 64-bit systems (memory addressing, registers)  
- Learned about processor manufacturing (wafers, lithography, layers)  
- Learned about computer history (Zuse Z3)  
- Overall widened the understanding of how computer operates and how it is manufactured
